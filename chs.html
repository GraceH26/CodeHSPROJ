        <hr>
           My name is Grace, I'm a junior at Frederick Douglass High School and I am 16 years old. 
           What I want to do in the future for college is hopefully go into computer science with a specialization in
           Cybersecurity. At FDHS I do Theater, Choir, the Ambassoder program, Music honors society,
           Stable Hands, and the choir leadership program. I also take several AP classes, and play the piano in my spare time.

            <em>What to know about me</em>
            <hr>
            Some things to know about me include several things like my hobbies, favorite foods, 
            what I do for work, my future plans, my friends, and more. My hobbies include singing,
            playing the piano, gaming, writing, theater, knitting, and sleeping. A lot of sleeping.
            Some of my favorite foods include mexican food, general things like tacos and quesadillas, chinese
            food, specifically dumplings, and italian food. Right now, I work at Panera Bread, but I am 
            planning to quit my job soon as I really don't get paid enough for what I have to deal with,
            hope my manager never sees this! Right now my future plans involve going to College, getting a degree
            involving computer science, and hopefully get a job that pays higher than my mom. I have lots of friends from
            different clubs and places around school. I want to get closer to some of my friends this year
            and be able to go out with them more once I get my license.
